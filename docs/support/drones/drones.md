# Drones

Drones are quickly becoming a tool that provides access to a variety of different types of data. Drones can support high resolution mapping, collecting LiDAR data, capturing video, and providing a different perspective from the air. 

Our Team can provide your project with drone data planning and collection, and support on how to integrate drone data into the project. ONA has access to a fleet of various drones and payloads (cameras) available to tackle different jobs. 

We not only collect data however, but we are also in the vanguard of analyzing drone data using different techniques and tools like Artificial Intelligence. Some of the outcomes of this analysis and others include plant health analysis, forest metrics, topographic maps, and point clouds.
