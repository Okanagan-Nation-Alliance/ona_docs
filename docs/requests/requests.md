# Requests for Work

Our GIS Team is always ready to support ONA staff and the Nation’s Communities. We have a few ways through which GIS work can be requested, and each is outlined below. 

**Fill out a work request form:** (ADD BUTTON) 

> Through this form you can share with us as much information as you’d like and our team will automatically get a support/request ticket delivered to them. 

**Contact us through email at [gis@syilx.org](mailto:gis@syilx.org):** 

> Send us an email outlining your current project needs and how you think we can help. One of our Team members will get back to you within 24 hours. 

**Find us at any of the Okanagan Nation Alliance offices (West Bank, Wade, and Castlegar) and talk to us directly to get the conversation started.**
